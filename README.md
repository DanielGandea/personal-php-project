# Personal PHP project that I dockerized.
This is a VLSM calculator website, made by me. Here are the requirements in order to run the web app.

# Prerequisites
Install PHP 8.4


__No packages__ required and __no build__ required for this website.


It just uses PHP for routing through the pages. It has the functionality of a VLSM / FLSM subnet calculator, all the computations made client-side with Javascript.


The app operates on port 8000.


# Start in production mode
To run the website locally use the command:
```
php -S localhost:8000
```
So it will be available on http://localhost:8000.
